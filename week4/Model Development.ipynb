    "## What is a Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A model can be thought as a mathematical equation used to predict a value given one or more other values.\n",
    "* Relating one or more inde pendent variables to dependent variables.\n",

    "* Linear regression will refer to one independent variable to make a prediction.\n",

    "Simple linear regression or **SLR** is method to help us understand the reation between two variables. \n",

    "# Simple Linear Regression: NOISE\n",
    "\n",
    "* In many cases, many factors influence how much people pay for a car. For example make or how old the car is. In this model, this uncertainty is taken into a account by assuming a small random value is added to the point on the line. This is called noise. \n",
